## Filtering Rows and Columns 

In SQL you can filter columns by using SELECT and rows by using WHERE. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. First, we should load the Lahman package. We will also need the sqldf package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, teamID, yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

## ORDER BY

With SQL, you can also order the rows in the output. For example, suppose you wanted to see every instance of a player hitting more than 50 homeruns. But you would like the players witht he most homeruns to be at the top of the list. Do it like this: 

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"

sqldf (query)
```
